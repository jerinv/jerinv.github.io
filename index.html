              <h3>Industry Productivity Analysis Web App</h3>
              <p>
                The Division of Industry Productivity Studies publishes labor productivity and costs data by industry on an annual basis. Every year,
				there are multiple releases - each one updating a different group of industries (i.e. manufacturing, trade, etc.). Economists analyze the updated data 
				and search for the main story in that industry group. Many approaches to analyzing the new data are repeated each year, across each release.
              </p>
			  <p>
			  My idea was that - if there are tasks being repeated, then there is an opportunity for automation. Using Python, I led a small team
			  in developing a web application that pulled live data from the division's SQL Server database, and allowed users to select different 
			  types of analysis to quickly obtain statistical calculations and visualizations. This product was well received by both
			  managers and analysts alike, as it automated the bread and butter analysis done in the office, and saved days of work done each year before each release.

              <h3>Voter Weight by U.S. State</h3>
              <p>
                The topic of the Electoral College and whether it should exist comes up as a hot debate every four years during the U.S. presidential election.
				It is well known that the Electoral College provides an advantage to voters in small states. But how big is this advantage?</p>
				<p>
				Using Microsoft Excel and Tableau, I created a visualization that quantified the amount of weight each voter has in each state. 
				It is shocking to see the difference in weights between small states and large states. A vote in Wyoming has nearly five times
				the amount of weight than a vote in California!

              <h3>Median Household Income Among Asian Americans</h3>
              <p>
                The U.S. Census Bureau reports Asians as the race with the highest median household income, as can be seen <a href = "https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/visualizations/2018/demo/p60-263/figure1.pdf">here</a>. 
				However, looking at this demographic at a more disaggregate level reveals a diverse socioeconomic experience within the group itself.</p>
				<p>
				For background - at work, I was frequently using the American Community Survey (ACS) for a project about labor composition. The ACS is one of the largest household surveys
				in the U.S., with nearly 3.5 million households surveyed per year. With the abundance of information it gathers, I wanted to use it to 
				answer a different question - what does household income look like among Asian Americans? I used Python to import, parse, and calculate the data
				I needed, and then used Microsoft Excel to create a visualization.

              <p>
                During the COVID-19 pandemic, many statistics that were used to compare the impact of the virus on countries 
				across the world. More specifically, the absolute number of COVID-19 deaths were repeated to us on a daily basis, 
				without taking into account the country's population. Using Python, I created a data visualization showing the 
				share of total COVID-19 deaths in some of the largest countries in the world, along with their share of the global population.

              <p>
                Following the (extremely disappointing) Game of Thrones finale, I was curious to know which characters had 
				the most screen time on the show. Using a large database put together by a very passionate Game of Thrones viewer, 
				I used Python to extract data and create a visualization that showed the top characters by screen time, broken down by season.
